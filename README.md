Welcome to John Deere's analytics workshop!

# Overview

Answer the questions below using the provided code, data, and any online resources, including **AI tools**. Each team is permitted two hints from John Deere employees.

_Note: The files generated are purposefully large to prevent LLMs from easily giving you the answers without needing to run any code._

# Scoring

Submit your answers [here](https://forms.gle/MqhuxGxvUDuLTGUD6). **All answers will be a positive integer.** A winner will be chosen by the following criteria, ranked in order of importance:

1. Most correct answers
2. Fastest submission

You must use your **submission pin** when submitting your team's answers. Each team can submit as many times as they wish, **only the most recent submission will be used**.

# Getting Started

**Setup your workspace**

Setup your workspace using a) git clone to local device b) using GitHub workspaces c) however else you wish to run things

**Install libraries**

Install all libraries found in `requirements.txt`

**Generate features.csv**

Run the script `generate_features.py`. A succesful output should have a new file of approximately 277MB stored at `data/features.csv`.

_Note: by using a constant random seed, we can ensure that all files are generated in the same manner. Verify that the first 10 lines of your file match the following table._

| id  | age | education   | occupation | state | marital_status | home_owner | pet_owner | travel_frequency |
| --- | --- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------------- |

**Check out notebook.ipynb**

Run through `notebook.ipynb` to get started. You will need to perform exploratory data analysis to be able to answer the questions.

# The Data

_Note: all data was generated programmatically. This is not a real dataset. The trends you expect to see may or may not appear in the dataset_

**`features.csv`: generated by users**

This file contains demographic features representing traits of individual people, each row pertaining to one person. 5 million rows.

_Note: due to the size of this file (and to preserve anonymity), this data is generated programmtically (using `generate_features.py`) using a constant random seed and will not appear on the GitHub repo_

**`target_known.csv`**

This file contains the `income` amount corresponding to `id` values in the `features.csv` file. 4.5 million rows.

**`target_unknown.csv`: hidden file**

This file (hidden until after the workshop) contains the income levels for the remaining 500,000 people.

# Questions

Answer the following questions related to the given datasets.

**All answers to be rounded to nearest integer**

For questions that relate to `income`, only consider the rows with known income (first 4.5 million of `features.csv`) for your answer.

1. How many individuals live in the state of TX?

2. How many currently married teachers in the state of IL are less than 20 years old?

3. What is the absolute value of the average difference between an engineer's income and a lawyer's income in the state of TX?

4. Find the absolute difference of a) the proportion of people in their 20s who are married / have been married and b) the proportion of people in their 30s who are married / have been married. Round you answer to 2 decimal places and multiply by 100. (e.g. if absolute proportional difference is 0.124203, return `12`)

5. Explore the relationship between income and occupation. Does it appear that occupation plays a significant role in income? Enter 2 for yes, 1 for no.

6. Explore the relationship between income and age. Does it appear that age plays a significant role in income? Enter 2 for yes, 1 for no.

7. Find the absolute difference between the median income and the mean income.

8. Predict the incomes for the remaining 500,000 individuals. What is the income of the individual with `id = 4795132`? _Answers within 20% of the actual value will be given credit_

9. Predict the incomes for the remaining 500,000 individuals. What is the income of the individual with `id = 4625316`? _Answers within 20% of the actual value will be given credit_

10. Predict the incomes for the remaining 500,000 individuals. What is the income of the individual with `id = 4956125`? _Answers within 20% of the actual value will be given credit_
