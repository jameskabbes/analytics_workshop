Welcome to John Deere's Python programming, analytics, and machine learning workshop!

# Overview

Answer the questions below using the provided code, data, and any online resources, including **AI tools**. Each team is permitted two hints from John Deere employees.

_Note_: The files generated are purposefully large to prevent LLMs from easily giving you the answers without needing to run any code.

# Scoring

Submit your answers [here](https://forms.gle/MqhuxGxvUDuLTGUD6). **All answers will be a positive integer.** A winner will be chosen by the following criteria, ranked in order of importance:

1. Most correct answers
2. Fastest submission

You must use your **submission pin** when submitting your team's answers. Each team can submit as many times as they wish, **only the most recent submission will be used**.

# Getting Started

**Setup your workspace**

Setup your workspace using a) git clone to local device b) using GitHub workspaces c) however else you wish to run things

**Install libraries**

Install all libraries found in `requirements.txt`

**Generate features.csv**

Run the script `generate_features.py`. A succesful output should have a new file of approximately 600MB stored at `data/features.csv`.

**Check out notebook.ipynb**

Run through `notebook.ipynb` to get started.

# The Data

_Note: all data was generated programmatically. This is not a real dataset. The trends you expect to see may or may not appear in the dataset_

**`features.csv`: generated by users**

This file contains demographic features representing traits of individual people, each row pertaining to one person. 5 million rows.

_Note: due to the size of this file (and to preserve anonymity), this data is generated programmtically (using `generate_features.py`) using a constant random seed and will not appear on the GitHub repo_

**`target_known.csv`**

This file contains the `income` amount corresponding to `id` values in the `features.csv` file. 4.5 million rows.

**`target_unknown`: hidden file**

This file (hidden until after the workshop) contains the income levels for the remaining 500,000 people.

# Questions

**All answers to be rounded to nearest integer**

For questions that relate to `income`, only consider the rows with known income (first 4.5 million of `features.csv`) for your answer.
